To ask the Minister for Health what measures have been put in place by the Government to curb the rise in illegal vaping in Singapore.

Answer

The Ministry of Health (MOH) takes a multi-pronged approach to curb the illicit sales and use of e-vaporisers. 

The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) monitors illicit sales of e-vaporisers via social media and messaging platforms and regularly carries out operations to target sales of e-cigarettes on these platforms. HSA also collaborates with platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and Carousell to remove postings on the illegal sales of such products. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority assists to detect illegal imports of e-vaporisers at the checkpoints and refer them to HSA for enforcement.
