Question No. 544

To ask the Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and Minister for Health (a) whether vape detection sensors are used in schools and public institutions; (b) if so, whether there are regulatory and deployment standards governing their use including (i) approval requirements (ii) technical specifications (iii) data and privacy safeguards and (iv) redress for false alerts; and (c) whether such standards will be published and enforced for trials and permanent rollouts.


Answer

1            Vape detection sensors are currently not used in public institutions.  Some schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have explored their usage but assessed them to be unsuitable for implementation.  Vape detection sensors are not regulated by MOH nor the Health Sciences Authority.
