Studies have shown that among smokers who are aware of the dangers of tobacco usage, three out of four wants to quit smoking. However, it is difficult for most tobacco users to quit on their own. They require help and support to overcome their dependence on tobacco and nicotine.

It was found that even very brief (1 minute) advice from physicians increases quit attempt success by 2%. Hence, a complementary smoking and vaping cessation e-learning module has been developed to equip aspiring professionals in the field of smoking and/or vaping cessation support with the latest substance abuse trends, skills on smoking and vaping counselling techniques as well as developments in the tobacco control sphere.

You, too, can help to make a difference in empowering fellow Singaporeans to start on their quit smoking journey!
