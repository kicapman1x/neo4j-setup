FOR THE SITTING OF PARLIAMENT ON OR AFTER 13 NOVEMBER 2024

MP for Jalan Besar GRC


Question No. 6284

To ask the Minister for Health (a) how effective are current enforcement strategies in reducing the availability and use of e-vaporisers, including their online availability; and (b) whether the Ministry can provide updated statistics on recidivism rates among individuals previously penalised for vaping offences.

Answer

1        Various agencies, led by the Ministry of Health (MOH), have been working together to improve effectiveness of enforcement against vaping. We stepped up enforcement operations at the land, sea and air checkpoints, heartland areas, malls and central business district, as well as at major events such as Formula 1 race, National Day Parade and music festivals. We also streamlined the processes, so that enforcement officers from the Singapore Police Force, National Environment Agency or National Parks Board can issue digital Notices of Composition on the spot to vaping offenders.

2        At the same time, the Health Sciences Authority has stepped up enforcement against online advertisements and sales of e-vaporisers and has worked with platform owners to remove about 6,000 offending listings in the first three quarters of 2024. In 2023, a total of about 3,000 listings were removed.

3        Among those penalised for vaping-related offences, about 15 per cent were repeat offenders.

4        Enforcement against vaping is a long-term effort. Many studies have shown that vaping is at least as harmful, if not more harmful than cigarette smoking. Yet we are fighting against an industry that is deliberately targeting young people, disguising harmful substance as cool lifestyle habit with a fruity taste. We will need more effective public education efforts, to inform the public of the harms of vaping. This would include working closely with the Ministry of Education, schools and Institutes of Higher Learning.
