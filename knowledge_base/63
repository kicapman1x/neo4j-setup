HSA Takes Action on Woman Filmed Vaping on MRT Train

The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has identified a 24-year-old woman who was filmed vaping on an MRT train in a social media video posted on 13 March 2025.

2          On 24 March 2025, HSA raided the woman’s residence, where one e-vaporiser and three e-vaporiser pods were found. HSA has tested that the e-vaporiser pods contain etomidate, a potent medicinal ingredient. The woman is currently assisting HSA in further investigations.

3          Etomidate is a medicinal ingredient used in clinical practice as an anaesthetic agent. It should only be administered under medical supervision. Adverse effects of etomidate include nausea and vomiting, uncontrollable movement or spasm of muscles, changes to breathing and blood pressure, seizures and psychosis as well as physical dependence.

4          HSA takes a serious view of the possession and use of e-vaporisers and will take stern action against offenders. This incident, in which the woman openly vaped on an MRT train, was a flagrant violation of the law.
Penalties for such offences in Singapore

5          The purchase, possession and use of e-vaporisers are prohibited in Singapore under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act.  This includes purchases made through the Internet and from overseas. Offenders can be fined up to $2,000.

6        Those found possessing or using pods containing etomidate are also liable upon conviction to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for up to 2 years and/or fine up to $10,000 under the Poisons Act.
