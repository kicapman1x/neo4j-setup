2.        In the morning of 30 October, acting on information received, a 42-year-old Singaporean man was arrested at his residential unit in the vicinity of Yishun Ring Road for suspected drug offences. When there was no response after officers identified themselves, they spotted the man in the kitchen and instructed him to open the door, which he complied. 

3.      A search of the unit was conducted and numerous vape-related products and cash amounting to SGD3,900 were seized. Suspecting the man might have disposed of items down the rubbish chute in the kitchen, CNB officers conducted a follow-up search of the rubbish chute linked to the unit, where a total of about 109 e-vaporiser pods and 11 e-vaporisers believed to contain etomidate were recovered.
