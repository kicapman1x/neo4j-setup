Measures at Checkpoints to Tackle Concealment of Controlled Drugs in Vapes

Published: 18 February 2025
Question:

Mr Christopher de Souza: To ask the Minister for Home Affairs what additional enforcement measures and detection capabilities are being developed to combat the emerging trend of drug-traffickers concealing controlled drugs within e-vaporiser devices, particularly at Singapore’s checkpoints.


Answer: 

Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law: 

1. The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) works closely with the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to detect the presence of controlled drugs at the checkpoints, including those concealed within e-vaporisers.

2. ICA conducts pre-arrival risk assessment of travellers and cargoes. Those assessed to be of higher risk will be subjected to more stringent checks upon arrival. These security checks are calibrated based on the prevailing security environment and specific threat assessments. In addition, CNB and HSA also conduct regular interagency operations at the checkpoints to detect and deter smuggling attempts.

3. Cases of controlled drugs concealed within e-vaporisers remain the minority of all drug seizures. CNB will continue to monitor the situation closely, as part of its zero tolerance approach towards the trafficking or importation of controlled drugs, regardless of the manner in which the drugs are conveyed.
