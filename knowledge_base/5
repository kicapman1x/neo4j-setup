NOTICE OF QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER

FOR THE SITTING OF PARLIAMENT ON 14 OCTOBER 2025


Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament

Mr Fadli Fawzi

MP for Aljunied GRC


Question No. 656

To ask the Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and Minister for Health (a) what is the number of private enforcement agencies that Health Sciences Authority (HSA) subcontracts for e-vaporiser enforcement activities; (b) what is the total number of staff in those agencies; and (c) in view of the harsher stance on e-vaporisers, whether there are plans for the Police to conduct e-vaporiser enforcement instead of HSA and its subcontractors.


Answer:

1        Enforcement against e-vaporisers offences is a whole-of-Government effort. Today, over 10,000 officers from various agencies, including the Singapore Police Force (SPF), are involved in enforcement against e-vaporisers. In addition, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) contracts about 100 staff from an external enforcement vendor to reinforce its own team for e-vaporiser enforcement activities.
