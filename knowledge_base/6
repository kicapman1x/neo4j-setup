Mr Sharael Taha

MP for Pasir Ris-Changi GRC


Question No. 227

To ask the Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider stronger deterrence by subjecting importers and distributors of vapes to the same penalties as those importing and distributing etomidate-laced vapes, in view of the finding that one in three confiscated vape devices tested positive for etomidate and given the potential ease of using vape devices to deliver other unknown drugs or substances in the future.


Answer

1          This question has been answered at the sitting on 22 September 2025.

2          The Ministry of Health is reviewing the longer-term legislation needed to adapt to the new landscape of e-vaporisers. This will include reviewing the appropriate penalties for suppliers of e-vaporisers of all kinds. We plan to enact this new legislation in the first quarter of 2026.
