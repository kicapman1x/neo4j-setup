HSA Collaborates with Singapore Nightlife Business Association to Combat Vaping at Nightlife Establishments

The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is collaborating with the Singapore Nightlife Business Association (SNBA) to remind patrons that vaping is illegal and to report e-vaporiser related offences at nightlife establishments.

2        As part of this partnership, nightlife establishments will display “Vaping is Prohibited” signage prominently at entrances and within their premises. The signage also features a QR code linked to HSA's online reporting portal (www.go.gov.sg/reportvape), enabling patrons and staff to report e-vaporiser activities, such as any illegal use or supply of e-vaporisers. To demonstrate zero tolerance towards vaping, nightlife establishments are also urged to deny entry to patrons found with or consuming e-vaporisers.

3        “Working with industry partners like SNBA helps strengthen ground-level deterrence and is an important part of HSA’s strategy to combat illegal vaping. Vaping has no place in daily life, including Singapore's nightlife entertainment scene. All nightlife establishments should work with us to keep their venues vape-free and report any illegal activities to the authorities,” said Adjunct Professor (Dr) Raymond Chua, HSA Chief Executive Officer.

4        “SNBA is committed to working closely with HSA to ensure that our nightlife venues remain safe, responsible, and compliant with the law. By supporting this initiative and making reporting channels easily accessible, we hope to protect the health of our patrons and staff, and preserve a positive nightlife experience for all,” said Danny Loong, President, Singapore Nightlife Business Association.
Penalties for e-vaporiser offences in Singapore

5        The purchase, possession and use of e-vaporisers are prohibited in Singapore under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act. HSA takes a serious view of these offences and will take stern action against those who violate the law. Offenders can be fined up to $2,000.

6        It is also an offence to import, distribute, sell or offer for sale e-vaporisers and their components. Any person convicted of an offence is liable to a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisonment of up to six months or both for the first offence, and a fine of up to $20,000, or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both for the second or subsequent offence. All prohibited tobacco items will be seized and confiscated.
Reporting channels for e-vaporiser offences

7        Even as the government has intensified surveillance and enforcement measures against e-vaporisers, members of the public continue to play a crucial role in our fight against illegal e-vaporiser activities. Those who have information on the illegal advertisement, import, distribution, sale or possession of e-vaporisers can contact HSA to support our enforcement efforts through two convenient channels:

-                Submit information through our online reporting form: www.go.gov.sg/reportvape or scan the QR code:

-                Call the Tobacco Regulation Branch at Tel: 6684 2036 or 6684 2037, operational daily, including weekends and public holidays, from 9am to 9pm

8        HSA has partnered with the People’s Association to place e-vaporiser disposal bins across the island at 26 Community Clubs and one Resident’s Network Centre for members of the public to voluntarily dispose of e-vaporisers safely. They can visit go.gov.sg/bin-vapes to locate the nearest bin. Persons who come forward to bin their e-vaporiser or voluntarily seek support for quitting will not face any penalties for doing so.

9        Information about the harms of e-vaporisers is available on the HealthHub website. Smokers or vapers who need help with quitting can call the Health Promotion Board’s toll-free Quitline at 1800-438-2000.
