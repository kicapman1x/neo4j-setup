21 May 2024

On 18 May 2024, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) conducted an operation which saw a large haul of drugs, including about 5.8kg of cannabis and 1,582g of ‘Ice’. The cocktail of drugs seized in the operation is estimated to be worth more than $707,000. The large amount of cannabis and ‘Ice’ seized can feed the addiction of 1,730 abusers for a week.

2. In the afternoon of 18 May, CNB officers arrested a 32-year-old Singaporean man on the ground floor of a residential block located in the vicinity of Jurong West Street 81. A search of a bag carried by the man saw the recovery of about 135g of ‘Ecstasy’, 756g of cannabis, 1,065g of ‘Ice’, 37 LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) stamps, 365 Erimin-5 tablets and 84 vape pods suspected to contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

3. CNB officers then escorted the man to his rental car which was parked at a multi-storey carpark nearby and recovered about 517g of ‘Ice’ and 5,052g of cannabis from within the car.
Various plastic bags containing plant matter, white powder, and cartridges on brown paper.

4. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Aaron Tang, Director Intelligence Division, said:

“The estimated worth of this large haul of drugs, nearly three-quarters of a million dollars, shows very clearly that drug traffickers’ only concern is to make as much profit as is possible, regardless of how many lives drugs may destroy, be it that of the abusers or their families and loved ones. Drug trafficking is all about profiting from the misery it inflicts on others. CNB will not let up on our efforts to neutralise drug trafficking activities and will continue to take out drug syndicates and traffickers so that they cannot inflict harm on the society.”

5. Under Section 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, it is an offence for a person, on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore, to traffic in a controlled drug, offer to traffic in a controlled drug; or to do or offer to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug. If a person is found guilty of trafficking more than 250g of methamphetamine or 500g of cannabis, he or she may face the mandatory death penalty.

6. Investigations into the drug activities of the arrested suspect are ongoing.
