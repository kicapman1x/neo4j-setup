Two teenagers among eight suspected drug offenders arrested in the vicinity of Woodlands Street 81 on 14 August 2023

3.         In the afternoon of 14 August, acting on information received, CNB officers arrested eight Singaporeans, including the two teenagers aged 15 and 17 in a residential unit in the vicinity of Woodlands Street 81 for suspected drug offences. The other suspects were aged between 37 and 59. Forced entry was effected as the occupants had disregarded the lawful orders of the officers to open the door. The two teenagers climbed onto the ledge from the bedroom window of the unit on the second floor in a bid to evade arrest but CNB officers were able to persuade them to return to safety. The other suspects put up a violent struggle during the arrest and had to be subdued by officers. Officers searched the unit and found about 1g of ‘Ice’, an ‘Ecstasy’ tablet and various drug paraphernalia. About 7g of ‘Ice’ and drug paraphernalia were also seized from the ground beneath the unit.
