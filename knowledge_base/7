232 PERSONS CAUGHT FOR E-VAPORISER OFFENCES, 14 CONFIRMED TO POSSESS ETOMIDATE VAPES, IN FIRST WEEK OF ENHANCED PENALTIES

8 September 2025

 


After enhanced penalties and enforcement for vaping offences came into force on 1 September, 232 individuals were caught for e-vaporiser related offences and 14 individuals have been confirmed to be in possession of e-vaporisers laced with etomidate.   

2.             The 232 individuals caught for vaping offences have been issued Notices of Composition (NOC) on the spot. Amongst them, 32 were suspected to be abusers of etomidate e-vaporisers. Following laboratory testing, 14 individuals have been confirmed to be in possession of e-vaporisers laced with etomidate. 7 were found to not possess e-vaporisers containing etomidate. The test results of the e-vaporisers for the remaining 11 individuals are pending.

3.             In line with the enhanced enforcement regime, etomidate abusers are required to attend rehabilitation in lieu of prosecution. Three offenders who have undergone investigation have been served notices to attend rehabilitation for up to six months. They will undergo programmes that focus on education, counselling, and support to help individuals overcome their addiction.

4.             The strengthened enforcement measures are part of the Government's comprehensive response against vaping and the use of e-vaporisers containing harmful substances such as etomidate. To step up enforcement, more than 5,000 frontline enforcement officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau, Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, Land Transport Authority, Ministry of Manpower, Singapore Civil Defence Force, Singapore Prison Service and public transport operators have been recently authorised by HSA to enforce against e-vaporiser users. This almost doubles the enforcement force which comprised officers from HSA, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority, Ministry of Education, National Environment Agency, National Parks Board, Singapore Customs and Singapore Police Force.

First etomidate e-vaporiser trafficker charged under Misuse of Drugs Act

5.             On 8 September 2025, HSA charged a 40-year-old man, Khor Boon Chun, Derek, for allegedly trafficking e-vaporiser pods containing etomidate. He is the first person to be charged under the Misuse of Drugs Act, after etomidate was classified as a Class C controlled drug on 1 September 2025.

6.             On 6 September 2025, the Police were alerted to a man behaving suspiciously at Block 631 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4. Upon Police’s arrival, officers found Khor to be in possession of an e-vaporiser and pod. Checks on Khor’s mobile phone revealed that he was allegedly involved in e-vaporiser trafficking activities.

7.             The case was referred to HSA for further investigations. A search of the vehicle conducted on 6 September 2025 uncovered around 50 e-vaporisers and related components including pods. The seized pods, sent to HSA Laboratory for testing, were positive for etomidate.

8.             The authorities thank members of the public for their vigilance in detecting illegal activities. The public plays an important role in supporting law enforcement efforts. In this case, the prompt reporting of suspicious behaviour enabled authorities to prevent illegal supply of e-vaporisers and distribution of harmful controlled drugs.

Support to quit

9.             The Government continues to provide support to those who need help and support to quit vaping. In the past week, 17 individuals have voluntarily sought help through the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and the four participating Social Service Agencies (SSAs) to quit the use of etomidate vaping. 21 individuals have signed up for the HPB I Quit programme for general vaping. Members of the public who want to quit vaping can tap on the QuitVape programme (gov.sg/stopvaping) or contact the Health Promotion Board (HPB)'s QuitLine at 1800 438 2000.

10.          Those who voluntarily seek help will not face any penalties nor have an offence record. However, if the individual is separately caught for vaping, penalties under the various laws will be meted out and there will be an offence record.

Avenues for the public to dispose of e-vaporisers    

11.          Over five weeks from 25 July to 31 August 2025, an estimated total of 6,000 e-vaporisers and related components, equivalent to six full bins, were voluntarily disposed by members of the public under the “Bin the Vape” initiative. The e-vaporisers and related components collected will be transported to the incineration plants for proper destruction under close supervision.  The bins, which were placed at selected locations, such as Community Clubs and Institutes of Higher Learning, have since been removed from 31 August 2025.

12.          The initiative demonstrated good community support for Singapore's anti-vaping efforts. As part of this effort, designated e-vaporiser disposal bins will continue to be made available for members of the public to voluntarily dispose of e-vaporisers safely at selected locations including border checkpoints and where QuitVape programmes and rehabilitation are provided (e.g. HPB, IMH and participating SSAs).

Enhanced penalties

13.          Under the enhanced framework that came into force on 1 September 2025, individuals found possessing, using, or purchasing e-vaporisers now face higher penalties and recalcitrant users will be required to undergo rehabilitation. Those who do not complete the rehabilitation programme will be prosecuted. Offenders caught using e-vaporisers for the third time and more will be prosecuted in court under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act 1993 and be liable for a fine of up to $2,000.

14.          Etomidate e-vaporiser offenders now face higher penalties and are required to attend rehabilitation for up to 6 months. Second-time offenders will be arrested and subjected to investigation and urine-testing, as well as mandatory supervision for 6 months which includes drug testing, and rehabilitation. Third-time offenders who are 16 years and older will undergo a 12-months regime, including detainment at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC), followed by drug testing and supervision.

15.          Importers, sellers and distributors of etomidate e-vaporisers will also face much stiffer penalties. This includes 3 to 20 years’ imprisonment and 5 to 15 strokes of the cane for importers, and 2 to 10 years’ imprisonment and 2 to 5 strokes of the cane for sellers and distributors.

16.          Members of the public continue to play a crucial role in our fight against illegal e-vaporiser activities. Those who have information on the illegal advertisement, import, distribution, sale or possession of e-vaporisers can contact HSA to support our enforcement efforts through two convenient channels:

-        Call the Tobacco Regulation Branch at Tel: 6684 2036 or 6684 2037, operational daily, including weekends and public holidays, from 9am to 9pm.

17.          Vaping is illegal in Singapore. The Government remains committed to strengthening enforcement efforts while providing support for those seeking to quit vaping. For more information, visit gov.sg/stopvaping.
