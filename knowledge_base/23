NOTICE OF QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER
FOR THE SITTING OF PARLIAMENT ON 1 MARCH 2023


Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament
Mr Murali Pillai
MP for Bukit Batok


Question No. 4284

To ask the Minister for Health having regard to the prevalence of vaping as a substitute for smoking and the potential for vaping and smoking activities to happen together, whether there is scope to consider synergising the enforcement capabilities of the Health Science Authority with the National Environment Agency to present a common front against vapers and those who are in breach of the prevailing regulations.


Answer

The Ministry of Health (MOH) takes a multi-pronged approach to address the issue of vaping, including working with our partner agencies to strengthen enforcement measures and public education efforts.

The Health Sciences Authority and the National Environment Agency are working together on a cross enforcement pilot for NEA’s enforcement officers to also enforce against vaping offences.
