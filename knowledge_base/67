Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Categorisation of Import and Sale of Vapes and Associated Products as a Serious Offence Under the Organised Crime Act 2015

Published: 09 January 2024

Question:

Mr Murali Pillai: To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether the import and sale of vapes and associated products can be categorised as a "serious offence" under the Organised Crime Act 2015 to enable Government authorities to target organised criminal groups involved in such activities. 


Answer: 

Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law:

1. For an offence to be listed as a serious offence in the Schedule of the Organised Crime Act (OCA), it must pose a serious threat to public safety and security in Singapore. The offence must also be one that is associated with organised crime in Singapore. Offences in the Schedule include murder, drug-trafficking, and unlicensed moneylending.

2. Based on these criteria, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Health Sciences Authority are assessing the Member’s suggestion of including offences involving vapes and associated products under the OCA.
