Quitting isn't easy. Yet, with a little support and lots of determination you can overcome every challenge. Research has shown that the chances of staying smoke-free improve by 5 times in the first 28 days of kicking the habit1.

I Quit Programme was originally a cold turkey SMS-based intervention that encourages smokers to stay smoke-free for 28 days. It breaks down the quit journey into daily, small actionable steps, empowering participants with knowledge, motivation and support to remain smoke-free through the crucial 28-day period.

To address evolving tobacco trends and to better support smokers and vapers, the programme had been enhanced with these features,

1) A triage survey to better understand a smoker's or vaper's level of nicotine dependence and preferences before recommending a programme for their cessation journey

2) Tele-counselling via QuitLine and a face-to-face counselling programme at pharmacies located islandwide

3) Follow up calls and monthly SMS up to the 12th month of the programme to encourage and motivate participants to remain nicotine-free and prevent relapse

4) Daily nudges with messages relevant to vapers to ensure all individuals seeking to quit receives relevant and effective support

I Quit Programme also has a social network of support through a Facebook page with 51,000 supporters. The I Quit Club page features real-life testimonials from ex-smokers, to inspire other smokers in their quit journey; posts from smokers seeking advice on how to quit; and comments from non-smokers penning words of encouragement to those trying to quit.
