       In the evening of 16 April 2025, a 41-year-old Singaporean man was arrested for attempting to smuggle a large amount of drugs including about 4,703g of heroin in a Malaysian-registered car arriving at Woodlands Checkpoint.

2.     Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers had directed the car for enhanced checks when they noticed the passenger exhibiting suspicious behaviour. ICA officers conducted a search and found a slab of 10 tablets believed to be controlled drugs on him. CNB officers were immediately alerted to the detection and officers then conducted further checks on the man and the car. A total of about 4,703g of heroin, 3,288g of cannabis, 1,613g of ‘Ice’ and 1,000 Erimin-5 tablets were seized from a bag found on the car’s floorboard. Cash of SGD689.60, MYR1,709 and THB1,000 were also seized.

3.     In the early morning of 17 April 2025, CNB officers escorted the man to his residence in the vicinity of Woodlands Drive. A search was conducted and about 307g of ketamine, 172g of ‘Ice’, 99g of Ecstasy and numerous vape devices suspected to contain controlled drugs were recovered from within the unit.

4.     The drugs seized have an estimated worth of more than SGD845,500 and could potentially feed the addiction of about 3,730 abusers for a week.

5.     Under Section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, those who import into or export from Singapore more than 15g of diamorphine or “pure heroin”, or more than 250g of methamphetamine, or more than 500g of cannabis may face the death penalty.

6.     ICA will continue to work with CNB to prevent attempts to smuggle drugs across our borders. ICA will also continue to conduct security checks at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle undesirable persons, weapons, explosives and other contrabands across our borders.
