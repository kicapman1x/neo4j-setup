Question No. 2531

To ask the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider capturing information pertaining to the prevalence of vaping as well as other forms of e-cigarettes in future rounds of the National Population Health Survey.

Answer

We have included questions on vaping in the National Population Health Survey. However, due to the illegal nature of vaping products, self-reported data from a survey conducted by health authorities may not be reliable. The Ministry of Health is reviewing various methods to better estimate the vaping prevalence.
