Reviewing Penalties and Powers of Seizure for Unauthorised Possession or Manufacturing of Equipment for Mixing Controlled Substances into Vapes

Published: 15 October 2025

Question:

Mr Cai Yinzhou: To ask the Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will review and increase penalties and powers of seizure for the unauthorised possession or manufacture of equipment (including tools like 3D printers) specifically designed or adapted for the illegal mixing of controlled substances into vapes, even if the tools themselves are free of controlled substances.

Answer:

Mr K Shanmugam, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs: 

1. Under section 10A of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), it is an offence to manufacture, supply, possess, import or export any equipment to be used to manufacture a controlled drug. Offenders can face imprisonment for up to 20 years or a fine of up to $200,000 or both. This is regardless of how the equipment is designed or how the controlled drugs are mixed.

2. Under section 24 of the MDA, Central Narcotics Bureau officers are empowered to seize any item, including equipment and tools, that are used to commit an MDA offence, or if they contain or constitute evidence of such an offence.

3. We assess that there is no need to review the penalties or powers of seizure, for now.
