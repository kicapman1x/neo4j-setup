17 May 2023

        Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) arrested five Singaporeans for suspected drug offences in anti-drug operations conducted on 15 May 2023. During the operations, a total of about 2,797g of heroin, 3,361g of cannabis, 384g of ‘Ice’, 43 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets and 162 Erimin-5 tablets, with an estimated street value of $360,900 were seized. The seizure of 2,797g of heroin, 3,361g of cannabis and 384g of ‘Ice’ can feed the addiction of about 2030 abusers for a week.

2.         In the evening of 15 May, CNB officers arrested four Singaporeans in the vicinity of Senja Road. A 33-year-old man was placed under arrest for suspected drug trafficking offences at a staircase landing of a residential block in the vicinity of Senja Road. Before the arrest, the man was seen leaving a flat located in the same block. CNB officers conducted a search on the man and about 956g of heroin and 24g of ‘Ice’ were recovered.

3.         CNB officers then raided the flat and arrested three occupants, aged 16, 17 and 39, for suspected drug offences. Forced entry was effected as the occupants refused to comply with the lawful orders of the officers to open the door. After entering the unit, CNB officers promptly arrested the 39-year-old man in the bathroom, where he was suspected to have been disposing controlled drugs into the toilet bowl. About 1,841g of heroin, 331g of ‘Ice’, 43 ‘Ecstasy’ tablets, 162 Erimin-5 tablets, various drug paraphernalia and offensive weapons were seized from within the unit.
Drugs: Bags of brown chunks, white powder, loose pills and blister packs on brown surface.

CNB officers conducted a search on the man and recovered about 10g of ‘Ice’ from him. The man was subsequently escorted to a residential unit where about 19g of ‘Ice’, 3,361g of cannabis, drug paraphernalia, and electronic vaporisers used to consume the cannabis-containing vaporiser pods were seized from within the unit.

5.       Under Section 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, it is an offence for a person, on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore, to traffic in a controlled drug, offer to traffic in a controlled drug; or to do or offer to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug. If a person is found guilty of trafficking more than 15g of pure heroin (diamorphine) or 250g of methamphetamine or 500g of cannabis, he or she may face the mandatory death penalty.

6.      Investigations into all arrested suspects are ongoing. Singapore adopts a strict policy of zero tolerance towards controlled drugs such as heroin, ‘Ice’ and cannabis. In some instances, controlled drugs such as cannabis are added as ingredients to edibles like candies and baked goods, or to vaping pods, and irresponsibly marketed as harmless consumables. Illicit drugs, including cannabis, are harmful, addictive and destroy lives, families and communities. The importation and exportation, possession, sale and consumption of controlled drugs or products containing controlled drugs is an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) 1973.

7.       The 2022 Health and Lifestyle Survey conducted by the Institute of Mental Health has found that for those who abused drugs, the mean age of onset of drug abuse was 15.9 and 52% of these abusers started out with cannabis. CNB would also like to urge parents to play an active part to protect our youths from the menace of drugs, and to remind their children that they should not consume or accept products unknown to them or offered by strangers. Some products may be marketed as ‘health’ products, and contain hemp, hemp seed oil, CBD oil, cannabis oil, or claimed to be free of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Any products containing hemp derivatives as an ingredient or derived from the Cannabis Sativa plant or its seeds can contain controlled drugs such as THC despite the product labels indicating otherwise.

8.       Members of the public can contact the CNB hotline at 1800-325-6666 for advice and assistance if they come across products or consumables suspected to contain drugs or are worried that their children may be involved with drugs. Those who have drug-related information can make a report to CNB by calling 1800-325-6666 or at https://www.eservices.cnb.gov.sg/feedback.
