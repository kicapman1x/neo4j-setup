Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament
Mr Yip Hon Weng
MP for Yio Chu Kang


Question No. 2776


To ask the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider enhancing the penalties for suppliers of e-cigarettes to better deter the sales of such items in Singapore.


Answer


1       Under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act, any person who is convicted of selling, offering for sale, possessing for sale, importing or distributing e-vaporisers, is liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for up to six months or to both for the first offence, and to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for up to 12 months or to both, for the second or subsequent offence. 

2       The Ministry of Health is closely monitoring the trends of e-vaporiser use and holistically reviewing the strategy against vaping, including legislated penalties, enforcement, deterrent and education measures, to reduce both demand and supply of e-vaporisers. We will continue to work with our partner agencies to curb and prevent e-vaporiser use.
