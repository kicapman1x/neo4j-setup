Question

To ask the Minister for Education (a) whether the Ministry has evaluated the use of vape detection sensors in schools and institutes of higher learning (IHLs); and (b) if so, (i) how many have trialed or deployed them; (ii) whether there are procurement guidelines, vetting and privacy safeguards for such use; and (iii) whether such guidelines will be issued to all schools and IHLs.
Response

1. Our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) use a variety of strategies to detect vaping on campus. They have implemented detection protocols, including guidelines to recognise potential signs of etomidate abuse, and coordination with Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for swift testing of vapes suspected to contain etomidate.

2. Some schools and IHLs have also trialled vape detection systems, but these were not scaled up due to issues with false positives. Our schools and IHLs will continue to look out for promising vape detection technologies and where relevant, assess their effectiveness before considering wider deployment.
