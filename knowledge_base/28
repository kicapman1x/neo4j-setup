Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament

MP for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC

Question No. 1502

To ask the Minister for Health whether there have been any studies done among the youth on their views on vaping and their awareness of the harmful side effects of vaping such as lung injury, respiratory issues, nicotine addiction, and second-hand e-cigarette vapour, such that the survey could also have the added benefit of deterring vaping among the youth.



Written Answer

The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has been monitoring and gathering intelligence on illicit sales of e-cigarettes via social media and messaging platforms, and from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2021, has carried out 201 operations targeting sales of e-cigarettes on online platforms. HSA also collaborates with platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and Carousell to remove postings on the illegal sales of such products. In 2021, 4,210 such postings were removed. Concurrently, the illegal importation of e-cigarettes is monitored at Singapore’s borders and intercepted as necessary to prevent entry of these e-cigarettes into the local market. These enforcement activities need to be complemented by public education efforts to deter the public, particularly youths, from vaping.

The Health Promotion Board (HPB) had previously conducted a survey in 2019 which found that almost seven in 10 young people were not aware that e-cigarettes contained harmful chemicals.

To further increase awareness of the harms and effects of e-cigarettes, HPB works closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) to incorporate more information on the harms of vaping in the virtual assembly skits and talks organised for the students. Training is also conducted to equip educators to discuss the harms of vaping with their students.

When students are caught using or possessing e-cigarettes and other types of vaporisers, school-based disciplinary action is also taken. They are reported to HSA who may fine recalcitrant offenders, and they are required to attend cessation programmes run by HPB. Students are guided by counsellors through their cessation journey to make long-term behavioural changes.

MOH, HSA and HPB will continue working together to enhance and expand the suite of existing measures to curb the supply and demand of e-cigarettes, to protect the health of the population.
