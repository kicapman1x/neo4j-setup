FOR THE SITTING OF PARLIAMENT ON 16 FEBRUARY 2024


Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament
Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim
MP for Sengkang GRC


Question No. 5710

To ask the Minister for Health for vape users who participate in the “I Quit” programme (a) whether these participants have been offered immunity from criminal prosecution; (b) how many have benefitted from this programme to date; and (c) what happens if the users are subsequently caught using vapes again.


Answer


1     Mr Speaker, the team that runs the I Quit Programme does not presume that participants currently possess or use vaping products, so participants need not worry that they will be fined or prosecuted just for joining the I Quit Programme, or for turning up for the sessions. That said, I Quit participants are not immune from criminal prosecution with regard to the illegal possession or use of vaping products. If caught, they are subject to the same enforcement actions as other offenders. 

2     A total of 112,000 participants have joined the I Quit programme since May 2014, the number is correct as of December 2023. The programme does not keep track of which participants are smokers or vapers.
