Ms Yeo Wan Ling

MP for Punggol GRC


Question No. 318

To ask the Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and Minister for Health (a) whether reports of abandoned vapes have increased in transport areas like bus interchanges, MRT stations or back of taxis and buses; (b) whether vape disposal bins can be extended to non-restricted areas at transport nodes; and (c) whether the Ministry can work with Public Transport Operators to develop Standard Operating Procedures and safety measures for confronting vape users.


Answer

1        Reports of abandoned e-vaporisers in transport areas have not increased.

2        E-vaporiser bins are placed where QuitVape and rehabilitation programmes are provided. Individuals are encouraged to discard their e-vaporisers at these locations, or where the e-vaporisers cannot be easily seen and picked up by another person.

3        About 1,000 frontline Public Transport Operator staff have been trained by the Health Sciences Authority to carry out enforcement activities in a consistent, fair and safe manner.
