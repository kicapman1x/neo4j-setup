WHOLE-OF-GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO TACKLE VAPING

28 August 2025

 

Stronger penalties from 1 September

Government agencies have been conducting stepped up enforcement against the use of e-vaporisers. The Government will further intensify efforts to combat vaping in Singapore, especially against the emerging trend of e-vaporisers containing harmful substances, such as etomidate.

2.             From 1 September 2025, individuals caught possessing, using or purchasing e-vaporisers will face higher penalties and recalcitrant users may be required to undergo rehabilitation.

3.             From 1 September 2025, etomidate and its analogues will be classified as Class C controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (MDA) for a period of six months, pending the Ministry of Health’s introduction of a more fit-for-purpose legislation. With this change, those who import, sell or distribute etomidate e-vaporisers will face prosecution under the MDA, and much higher penalties than today. Individuals found using etomidate e-vaporisers or who test positive for etomidate will no longer be just subject to a fine. They can be subject to rehabilitation, treatment, mandatory supervision and detention.

4.             The Government will continue to provide support to those seeking help to quit vaping.

Intensifying Enforcement and Higher Penalties for e-Vaporisers users

5.             Studies have shown that vaping pose significant health risks. That is why the Government has banned e-vaporisers from the start and enforcing against its illegal import, sale and use. However, the situation has become even more serious, with e-vaporisers now also becoming delivery vehicles for harmful substances such as etomidate. Etomidate e-vaporisers pose serious harm to users, including adverse effects on the brain. A few cases of unnatural deaths and a fatal accident has been linked to the use of etomidate.

6.             To deter the use of e-vaporisers, enforcement and operations against vaping will be heightened. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) have stepped up the conduct of joint enforcement operations with Health Sciences Authority (HSA), and will continue to refer any vaping offences found in the course of their operations and responses to law and order incidents to HSA. In addition, agencies have stepped up enforcement in public spaces such as MRT stations, bus interchanges, parks and institutional premises such as schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). For example:

a.             Public transport operators have stepped up enforcement across the public transport network. Frontline staff are conducting roving patrols on trains and at public transport nodes. Bus Captains have been referring individuals caught vaping at bus interchanges for investigation. Transit Security Officers have been conducting more bag checks for e-vaporisers.

b.              The National Parks Board (NParks) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) have been conducting enforcement patrols at public places.

c.              Schools and IHLs have remained vigilant to vaping among students and will take stricter disciplinary action against offenders. IHLs have increased the frequency of campus patrols. Designated staff members will be empowered and trained to carry out enforcement measures in schools and IHLs.

d.             The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and the Home Team (HT) have stepped up detection and enforcement measures within their premises. These include enhanced checks for e-vaporisers at access control points and within premises. The SAF and HT also have in place a comprehensive urine screening framework to monitor for substance abuse. This will be expanded to include testing for etomidate.

7.             There will also be stepped up enforcement and enhanced levers to deter smuggling and syndicated activities.

a.             The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has intensified checks at the checkpoints against the smuggling of e-vaporisers.

b.             E-vaporiser offences will be scheduled under the Organised Crime Act 2015, Online Criminal Harms Act 2023, and the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992, to significantly strengthen the actions that can be taken against sellers, smugglers and syndicates, including requiring the take-down of online vaping content and confiscating the proceeds from sales of e-vaporisers.

8.             From 1 September 2025, offenders found possessing, using or purchasing e-vaporisers will be subjected to higher penalties.

a.                  First-time offenders will be issued a Notice of Composition (NOC) of $500 (for offenders under 18 years old) and $700 (for adults). This is an increase from the current NOC of $300 and $500, respectively.

b.                  Second-time offenders will be required to attend rehabilitation for three months. Those who do not complete the rehabilitation programme will be prosecuted.

c.              Offenders caught using e-vaporisers for the third time and more will be prosecuted in court under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act 1993 and be liable for a fine of up to $2,000.

Enhanced Penalties for Etomidate Abusers

9.             In particular, with the listing of etomidate as a Class C Drug under the MDA, etomidate e-vaporiser offenders will face stiffer penalties:

a.              First-time offenders will be issued an NOC of $500 (for offenders under 18 years old) and $700 (for adults). In addition, they will be required to attend rehabilitation for up to 6 months.

b.              Second-time offenders will be arrested. They will be investigated by CNB, which includes statement-taking and urine testing. Offenders will be required to undergo mandatory supervision for 6 months which includes drug testing and rehabilitation.

c.              Offenders who do not complete the rehabilitation programmes will be prosecuted in court.

d.              Offenders who are 16 years old and older, caught for the consumption of etomidate for the third time and more, will be admitted to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) for treatment and rehabilitation under MDA. They will undergo rehabilitation programmes in the DRC and subsequently undergo drug testing and supervision for 12 months.

e.              Those who are under 16 years old will be subjected to mandatory supervision in the community for 12 months.

10.          Importers, sellers and distributors of etomidate e-vaporisers will also face much stiffer penalties under the MDA:

a.             Importers are liable for between 3 to 20 years’ imprisonment and 5 to 15 strokes of the cane.

b.             Sellers and distributors are liable for between 2 to 10 years’ imprisonment and 2 to 5 strokes of the cane.

Disciplinary Actions in Specific Settings

11.          In addition, disciplinary actions will be taken in the following settings:

a.                  HT Regular Officers risk dismissal for etomidate abuse, while HT National Servicemen face fines and demotions or detention, in addition to the penalties they may face under the national framework.

b.             Consistent with its approach for other controlled drugs, SAF personnel will be dealt with separately under military law. Punishments range from fines to detention in SAF Detention Barracks, and SAF Regulars may be discharged from service. These SAF personnel will also undergo a mandatory rehabilitation programme.     

c.              Use of e-vaporisers, not just etomidate abuse, are serious offences in schools and IHLs, and students caught for vaping and substance abuse are reported to HSA and CNB, respectively. These students will also face additional school or institution-based disciplinary consequences. From 1 September 2025, there will be a stricter framework to guide schools to mete out detention, suspension and/or caning (for boys only) for e-vaporisers-related offences. Schools will also adjust the conduct grade of the student offender and take rehabilitative measures, such as counselling. Recalcitrant offenders will face harsher measures. For IHLs, the stepped-up disciplinary measures include withdrawal of privileges, such as leadership opportunities, overseas exchanges and/or scholarships, eviction from hostel for university students, fines and/or community service orders. Recalcitrant students and student e-vaporiser traffickers will face suspension or dismissal.

12.          Foreigners who visit or live in Singapore must abide by our laws. Foreigners who are found in possession of e-vaporisers will have their e-vaporisers seized and be issued a Notice of Composition.  

13.          Repeat offenders will face more severe consequences. Short-Term Visit Pass holders who re-offend will be banned from re-entering Singapore upon departure.  

14.          Those on a long-term pass or immigration facility, such as Employment Pass, S Pass, Work Permit, Student’s Pass, Long-Term Visit Pass, or Dependant’s Pass, may also have their pass or immigration facility revoked on a third offence, and be deported and banned from re-entering Singapore thereafter.        

15.          Foreigners caught possessing or using etomidate e-vaporisers or who test positive for etomidate may have their pass or immigration facility revoked, and be deported and banned from re-entering Singapore.

16.          Any appeals will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Support to Quit                                                                                     

17.          Users of e-vaporisers are strongly urged to quit immediately. Support is provided for those who wish to quit, under the QuitVape programme. Those who are using etomidate e-vaporisers can seek help from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), WE CARE Community Services, Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association, Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities and Fei Yue Community Services. The public can also seek help for smoking and vaping cessation from the Health Promotion Board’s (HPB) QuitLine at 1800 438 2000.

18.          Those who voluntarily seek help will not face any penalties nor have an offence record. However, if the individual is separately caught for vaping, penalties under the various laws will be meted out and there will be an offence record.

19.          SAF service personnel may approach their Commanders and Medical Officers for assistance, or call the SAF Counselling Hotline (24 Hour): 1800 278 0022. HT Regulars and NSFs who wish to seek help for smoking / vaping cessation may seek professional help at HT medical centres and clinics. Service Personnel who wish to receive cessation support will be given the tools, counselling and support necessary to recover.

20.          E-vaporiser disposal bins will continue to be available for members of the public to voluntarily dispose of e-vaporisers at selected locations, such as where rehabilitation and QuitVape programmes are provided. The bins that had previously been placed at Community Clubs and Residents’ Network Centre, as well as IHLs, will be removed with effect from 31 August 2025.

Public Education

21.          In tandem with stepped up enforcement, the Government will intensify public education to raise awareness of the harms of vaping, and discourage Singaporeans from picking up such dangerous habits.

22.          HPB will continue to work with MOE to carry anti-vaping messages in educational materials and preventive programmes, and provide resources for parents. Parents can also access resources and relevant information on Parent Hub and the Families for Life website, including on how to initiate conversations with their children about vaping.

23.          At the national level, HPB has an ongoing “Don’t Toy With Your Life” campaign. Rolled out in June 2025, the campaign educates youths on the dangers of vaping and provides resources on cessation support.

24.          gov.sg has amplified communications on the illegality and harms of vaping across multiple platforms. A gov.sg microsite (gov.sg/stopvaping) was also launched on 18 August 2025. The site provides information on the harms of vaping as well as resources, helplines and reporting avenues for the public. Resources are also available on the IMH website Smoking and Vaping - National Addictions Management Service (NAMS).
