MP for Sengkang GRC


Question No. 801

To ask the Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and Minister for Health for persons seeking support for vape addiction under the National Addictions Management Service (a) what is the framework and duration for the treatment and rehabilitation of such persons; and (b) whether there can be scheduling flexibility to ensure continuity in the treatment process.


Answer

1        Government has decided to take firm enforcement action against etomidate abuse.  Just like drugs, etomidate is very harmful to the individuals and to their families and loved ones. 

2        However, given that many etomidate abusers are young people who inadvertently picked up the habit through peers, MOH is providing them a chance to come forward to seek help to quit the habit, and no enforcement actions will be taken against them.  They can turn over a new leaf.  But if caught, they can be subject to severe penalties.  

3        Hence, this is not a medical service, subject to the convenience of the individual seeking support.  We hope to see commitment and desire amongst the abusers to correct their mistakes.  It must therefore follow that appointments are scheduled based on the availability of the National Addictions Management Service professionals.
