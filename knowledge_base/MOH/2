Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament:  
Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim, MP for Sengkang GRC  

Question No. 5710:  
To ask the Minister for Health, for vape users who participate in the “I Quit” programme:  
(a) whether these participants have been offered immunity from criminal prosecution;  
(b) how many have benefitted from this programme to date; and  
(c) what happens if the users are subsequently caught using vapes again.

Answer:

1. The team running the I Quit Programme does not presume that participants currently possess or use vaping products. Participants need not worry that they will be fined or prosecuted simply for joining the I Quit Programme or attending its sessions. However, I Quit participants are *not* immune from criminal prosecution regarding illegal possession or use of vaping products. If they are caught, they are subject to the same enforcement actions as other offenders.

2. A total of 112,000 participants have joined the I Quit Programme since May 2014, as of December 2023. The programme does not track whether participants are smokers or vapers.
