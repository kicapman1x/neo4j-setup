Title: Avenues to Surrender E-Vaporisers and Seek Support to Quit Vaping
Date: 25 July 2025
Document Type: Press Release

Topic:
National initiative “Bin the Vape” to encourage Singapore residents to safely surrender e-vaporisers before etomidate becomes a Class C illegal drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), and to guide users—especially etomidate users—towards professional quitting support.

Summary:
- The Minister for Health announced that **etomidate** will soon be classified as a **Class C controlled drug** under the MDA. This criminalises consumption, possession, trafficking, and distribution of etomidate—including in e-vaporisers—and enables enforcement such as arrest, supervision, and DRC detention.
- As the new classification approaches, individuals currently using e-vaporisers, especially **etomidate-laced devices**, are strongly advised to stop immediately.
- To support the quitting process, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) launched **“Bin the Vape”**, a safe disposal initiative enabling users to surrender devices voluntarily without penalty.
- **23 Community Clubs + 1 Residents’ Network Centre** now host secured vape disposal bins from **25 July 2025**. More bins will be rolled out progressively, including in Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs).
- Members of the public can find their nearest bin via **go.gov.sg/bin-vapes**.
- Individuals wishing to quit—especially those consuming etomidate—may seek help from **WE CARE Community Services**, **SANA**, **Institute of Mental Health (IMH)**, or **Quitline (1800 438 2000)**.
- Anyone who comes forward to **surrender vapes** or **seek help voluntarily** will **NOT** face penalties.
- Once the law is in force, those caught consuming etomidate vapes will face **mandatory supervision**, **rehabilitation**, or **prosecution for repeat offences**. Trafficking or distributing etomidate vapes may lead to **imprisonment up to 20 years** and **caning**.
