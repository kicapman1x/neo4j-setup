Title: Remarks by Mr Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Health, on Vaping Enforcement
Date: 20 July 2025
Document Type: Speech (Doorstop Interview)
Topic: Escalating vaping risks and inter-agency enforcement

Summary:

- Context:
  - Rising concern over e-vaporisers, particularly those laced with etomidate.  
  - Etomidate is a controlled psychoactive substance causing organ failure, hallucinations, and implicated in deaths.  

- Key Points:
  1. Legal framework:
     - E-vaporisers banned under Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sales) Act.
     - Etomidate regulated under Poisons Act; plans to list as Class C drug under Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) for stricter measures.  
  2. Enforcement:
     - Multi-agency approach involving MOH, MHA, Police, CNB, NEA, NParks, LTA.  
     - Interim penalties: fines for users, jail for sellers; under MDA, users face mandatory rehabilitation, supervision, and jail for repeat offences.  
     - Over 100 vapes tested; ~1/3 contained etomidate.  
  3. Reporting and Hotline:
     - Hotline extended to 7 days/week, 9am–9pm; 24/7 online reporting available.  
     - Confidential reporting encouraged; enforcement capacity is current limiting factor.  
  4. Schools:
     - Past tests from school-seized vapes found no etomidate, but latest public seizures suggest potential risk; vigilance required.  
  5. Public messaging:
     - Immediate cessation urged for etomidate-laced vaping.  
     - Highlighted need for whole-of-government coordination due to e-vaporisers being conduits for multiple substances.

Key Entities:
- Ministry of Health (MOH)
- Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)
- Health Sciences Authority (HSA)
- Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB)
- National Environment Agency (NEA)
- National Parks Board (NParks)
- Land Transport Authority (LTA)
- Police
- Public and school communities

Key Concepts:
- Escalation of vaping risks (etomidate-laced vapes)
- Multi-agency enforcement and collaboration
- Interim and long-term legal measures (Tobacco Act, Poisons Act, MDA)
- Public reporting and hotline accessibility
- Risk monitoring in schools
