Body:
Electronic vapourisers (e-vapourisers) are not nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products. In Singapore, NRT products such as nicotine patches and gums must undergo stringent evaluation to be registered under the Health Products Act.

There is currently limited evidence that e-vapourisers aid smoking cessation. To date, no application has been submitted to the Health Sciences Authority to register e-vapourisers as therapeutic products for smoking cessation.

The World Health Organization does not recognise e-vapourisers as legitimate smoking cessation aids. Evidence indicates that e-vapourisers serve as a gateway for non-smokers, especially young people, to start smoking cigarettes.

Vaping is harmful to health. E-vapourisers commonly contain nicotine — a highly addictive substance that harms brain development in teenagers. They also contain carcinogenic chemicals and toxic substances such as metal nanoparticles and particulate matter (PM2.5), which increase risks of lung and heart diseases.

The Ministry of Health is taking measures to protect the population and prevent vapes from taking hold in society.

Vaping is illegal in Singapore. Importation, distribution, sale, possession, use, and purchase of e-vapourisers are banned. Under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act, individuals convicted of selling, offering for sale, possessing for sale, importing, or distributing e-vapourisers may face fines up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to six months, or both, for a first offence; and up to $20,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both, for subsequent offences.

The Health Promotion Board has rolled out a digital campaign to raise awareness of the negative health effects of vaping and address misconceptions. MOH also works with the Ministry of Education to educate children and young people on the harms of vaping and encourage nicotine-free lifestyles.
