NOTICE PAPER NO. 3322  
NOTICE OF QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER  
FOR THE SITTING OF PARLIAMENT ON or after 8 January 2025  

Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament:  
Ms Hany Soh, MP for Marsiling–Yew Tee GRC  

Question No. 6429:  
To ask the Minister for Health:  
(a) what is the number of cases of “KPods” or vape juices mixed with etomidate detected in 2024;  
(b) how HSA is conducting enforcement against such sale and consumption; and  
(c) whether HSA offers support to consumers seeking to cease the habit.

Written Answer:

The Ministry of Health (MOH), together with the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and other partner enforcement agencies, has been stepping up physical and online checks to enforce the ban on importation, supply, possession, and use of e-vaporisers. As of 31 December 2024, HSA has issued fines to more than 14,000 individuals for possession and use of e-vaporisers, and removed about 6,800 offending online listings. This is double the 2023 figures, where about 7,800 composition fines were issued and 3,000 listings were removed.

Based on samples of e-vaporiser pods submitted for testing, five cases of e-vaporisers containing etomidate were detected, and investigations are ongoing. As etomidate is classified as a poison under the Poisons Act, a licence is required for its importation and sale. HSA takes a serious view of illegal sales and use of etomidate, and will take strict enforcement actions. Contrary to claims by online sellers, individuals who consume such e-vaporisers may also have etomidate detected in their urine.

Individuals found supplying etomidate-containing pods are liable upon conviction to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for up to two years and/or a fine of up to $10,000 under the Poisons Act. The detection of etomidate-laced e-vaporisers underscores the harm of vaping and strengthens MOH’s commitment to enforcing the ban on importing, supplying, possessing, or using all types of e-vaporisers.

I Quit, a programme by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), is available to support individuals who wish to stop vaping.
