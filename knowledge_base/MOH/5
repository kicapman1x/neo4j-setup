Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament:  
Miss Rachel Ong, MP for West Coast GRC  

Question No. 7300:  
To ask the Minister for Health:  
(a) For each year from 2022 to 2024, what is the total number of students studying in schools and Institutes of Higher Learning who were caught using or possessing vapes;  
(b) whether the Ministry has data on the percentage of students who reoffended after being fined for first-time vaping violations during this period; and  
(c) whether, based on this data, the Government will review penalties for first-time and repeat vaping offenders.

Answer:

Over the past three years, due to ramped-up enforcement by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) together with the Ministry of Education, the number of students from schools and Institutes of Higher Learning reported to HSA for possessing or using e-vaporisers increased from approximately 800 cases in 2022, to 900 cases in 2023, and 2,000 cases in 2024. Among the 2024 cases, 13% reoffended within the same year.

HSA and the Ministry of Health are reviewing penalties for possession or use of e-vaporisers. Concurrently, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) will increase initiatives to educate and counsel youths and students on the benefits of a nicotine-free lifestyle, as well as provide vaping cessation programmes.
