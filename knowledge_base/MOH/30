Comprehensive nationwide measures taking effect from 1 September 2025 to suppress vaping, including increased penalties, classification of etomidate as a Class C controlled drug, intensified enforcement across all public, education, military and border environments, stronger actions against syndicates, and expanded cessation support.

Summary:
1. **Stronger Penalties for E-Vaporiser Users (from 1 Sept 2025):**
   - Possession, use, or purchase of ANY e-vaporiser remains illegal under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act (TCASA).

     • Composition fine up to **$2,000**.  
     • Device confiscation.  
   - Repeat offenders:
     • Mandatory participation in **rehabilitation programmes**, which may include counselling, education modules, behavioural interventions, or periodic check-ins.  
     • Potential referral for social support if youth or vulnerable groups are involved.  
   - Under-18 offenders:
     • Referred to youth diversion programmes (e.g., guidance counselling, family engagement).  
     • Schools/youth agencies may be notified for follow-up.
