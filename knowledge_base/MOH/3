Written Answer:

Mr Speaker, we have addressed similar questions at the previous sitting, and the answer has been provided in the Circular for Written Answers for Questions 33 and 34 on 6 August 2024. Nevertheless, for completeness, I will provide a reply to this Question today and invite the Member to seek clarifications if needed.

It is not mandatory for taxi and private hire car drivers to report vaping by passengers. However, they may do so to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) via its hotlines.

The identities of persons who report such cases to HSA are kept confidential. Drivers will also not be penalised for passengers vaping in their vehicles. If passengers retaliate or become uncooperative, drivers may seek assistance from the relevant authorities, such as the Singapore Police Force, where appropriate.
