Title: Enhancing Vape Detection in Schools and Counselling for Students Caught Vaping  
Date: 23 September 2025  
Document Type: Parliamentary Reply (Combined Written/Oral Answer)

Topic:
MOE’s plans on vape detection systems in schools and IHLs, use of nicotine test kits, improving detection, peer vigilance culture, counselling support, and updated disciplinary and rehabilitative frameworks.

Summary (Ultra-Granular):
- Two MPs, Miss Rachel Ong and Mr Sharael Taha, ask about vape detector installation, detection improvements, nicotine test kit use, peer vigilance strategies, and counselling for students.
- MOE responds with a combined reply covering prevention, detection, disciplinary action, counselling support, peer-led culture-building, and collaboration with HPB and HSA.
- Schools and IHLs do not rely solely on vape detectors; they implement multi-layered detection protocols and may use nicotine test kits when warranted.
- From 1 Sep 2025, MOE has implemented standardised disciplinary measures across schools and stricter sanctions across IHLs.
- Students who voluntarily seek help are exempted from discipline.
- Counselling support is available through in-house counsellors and external addiction support organisations.
- Anti-vaping education is embedded across curriculum subjects and parent engagement channels.

Detailed Breakdown (Ultra-Granular):

1. **Scope of Questions Addressed**
   - This response consolidates Q108 and Q109 from:
     - Miss Rachel Ong (Tanjong Pagar GRC)
       - Asked about compulsory vape detectors and counselling access for IHL students caught vaping.
     - Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris–Changi GRC)
       - Asked about:
         - More effective vape detection methods,
         - Implementation of nicotine test kits,
         - Designing a supportive “peer vigilance culture”,
         - Better supporting identified vape users.
   - Also covers queries from Ms Lee Hui Ying and Ms Valerie Lee for later sittings, indicating wider parliamentary interest.

2. **MOE’s Overall Detection Philosophy**
   - Vape detectors **will not be mandated** nationwide.
   - Detection is **multi-pronged**, not reliant on hardware tools.
   - Schools and IHLs:
     - Apply **detection protocols** (formalised processes).
     - Are trained to recognise **signs of vaping** and specifically **etomidate abuse indicators**, reflecting rising drug-laced vape concern.
     - Collaborate with **HSA** for **swift laboratory testing** when suspected vapes are found.
     - This ensures rapid confirmation of substances, including nicotine or drugs like etomidate.

3. **Use of Nicotine Test Kits**
   - When schools have reasonable suspicion:
     - Students are interviewed.
     - Parents are **notified before testing**.
     - Nicotine test kits (likely saliva/urine-based) may be used as part of the investigative process.
   - These tests help verify vaping behaviour but are deployed with parental transparency to maintain trust.

4. **Peer Vigilance Culture**
   - Instead of punitive peer policing, MOE frames it as:
     - Positive peer support networks.
     - Student-led initiatives promoting:
       - Healthy lifestyles,
       - Help-seeking behaviours,
       - Connection to trusted adults and healthcare professionals.
   - This aims to prevent a “snitch culture,” replacing it with a culture where peers help each other access support.

5. **Disciplinary Framework (Effective 1 Sep 2025)**
   - **Schools (Primary/Secondary/JC/MOE schools):**
     - Baseline disciplinary actions:
       - Detention,
       - Suspension,
       - **Caning for boys** (formal corporal punishment),
       - Conduct grade adjustments.
   - **IHLs (Polytechnics, ITE, Universities):**
     - Stricter sanctions reflecting older age group and campus autonomy:
       - Eviction from hostels,
       - Removal of privileges (leadership roles, overseas exchanges),
       - Community service orders,
       - Monetary fines,
       - Suspension or **expulsion** for recalcitrant offenders.
   - All consequences are proportionate to offence severity.

6. **Rehabilitative Approach**
   - Beyond sanctions, schools/IHLs aim to:
     - Help students understand reasons behind rules.
     - Encourage ownership of their behaviour.
     - Support long-term behavioural change.
   - MOE acknowledges rehabilitation is **non-linear**, requiring repeated interventions and sustained support.

7. **Students Who Seek Help Voluntarily**
   - They face **zero disciplinary penalties**.
   - This encourages early intervention and reduces fear of coming forward.

8. **Counselling and Support Services**
   - In-house counsellors in schools/IHLs provide:
     - Individual counselling,
     - Habit-change support,
     - Emotional regulation guidance.
   - External support referrals include:
     - **HPB QuitLine**,
     - **National Addictions Management Services (NAMS)**,
     - **WE CARE Community Services**,
     - **Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA)**.
   - For students **arrested** for vaping offences:
     - Schools/IHLs work with families and community partners for:
       - Rehabilitation,
       - Reintegration,
       - Prevention of reoffending.

9. **Staff Training and Professional Resources**
   - MOE + HPB collaboration:
     - HPB developed an online module on smoking and vaping cessation.
     - Helps teachers and staff:
       - Recognise vaping behaviours,
       - Guide cessation conversations,
       - Identify students needing referral.

10. **Curriculum and Education Efforts**
   - Anti-vaping messaging integrated across:
     - Science,
     - Physical Education,
     - Character and Citizenship Education (CCE).
   - Reinforced via:
     - Regular assembly talks,
     - Educational packages.
   - Parent engagement includes semestral joint HPB-HSA advisories through Parents Gateway.
   - IHLs include:
     - Mandatory orientation modules,
     - Hostel-focused outreach.

11. **Holistic, Multi-Touchpoint Framework**
   - MOE emphasises the “three pillars”:
     - **Prevention** (education, parent engagement, peer support),
     - **Detection** (protocols, test kits, potential tools, staff vigilance),
     - **Support** (counselling, referrals, rehabilitation pathways).
   - Balances:
     - School safety,
     - Student recovery and restoration.
   - Goal:
     - Provide firm boundaries but maintain pathways back to growth for students who make mistakes.
