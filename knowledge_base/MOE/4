Topic:
Minister Desmond Lee outlines MOE’s role in whole-of-Government efforts to tackle vaping among youth, including education, outreach, enforcement, peer support, and collaboration with parents and community.

Summary (Ultra-Granular):

- Whole-of-society approach encouraged, involving parents and communities in prevention, detection, and reporting.
