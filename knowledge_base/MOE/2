Title: Evaluation on Vape Detection Sensors Usage in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning  
Date: 6 November 2025  
Document Type: Parliamentary Reply (Written Answer)

Topic:
MOE’s evaluation of vape detection sensors in schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), including trials, detection methods, privacy considerations, and reasons for limited deployment.

Summary (Ultra-Granular):
- The question from Dr Hamid Razak (West Coast–Jurong West GRC) asks whether MOE has evaluated vape detection sensors, how many schools/IHLs use them, and whether procurement and privacy guidelines exist or will be issued.
- MOE responds that:
  - Schools and IHLs use **multiple detection strategies**, not just sensors.
  - They have **formal detection protocols**, including identifying signs of **etomidate abuse**.
  - They coordinate with **HSA** for rapid testing when vapes are suspected to contain etomidate.
  - Some institutions trialled vape detection sensors, but **false positives** prevented scale-up.
  - MOE is open to adopting new technologies, evaluating them for effectiveness before further deployment.

Detailed Breakdown (Ultra-Granular):

1. **Detection Strategies in Schools and IHLs**
   - Both schools and IHLs employ “a variety of strategies” to detect vaping on campus.
   - This includes **human-based detection**, **teacher vigilance**, **student reports**, and **behavioural monitoring**.
   - Detection protocols specifically cover:
     - How to **identify potential signs of vaping**.
     - How to recognise **etomidate abuse indicators** (suggesting concern about drug-laced vapes).
   - Staff are guided on early detection and immediate escalation procedures.

2. **Protocols for Etomidate-Related Risks**
   - Etomidate is an anaesthetic agent that has been found in illicit vapes.
   - Schools/IHLs have:
     - Guidelines on **spotting behavioural symptoms** or signs consistent with etomidate exposure.
     - A defined process to **flag suspicious vapes**.
   - There is **direct coordination with HSA**:
     - When a vape is suspected to contain etomidate, the school contacts HSA for **expedited testing**.
     - Rapid identification helps determine if urgent medical intervention or disciplinary action is needed.

3. **Vape Detection Sensor Trials**
   - Some schools and IHLs have **trialled vape detection sensors** (brand-agnostic, technology not specified).
   - Trials involved:
     - Testing sensors in toilets, stairwells, and enclosed areas where vaping typically occurs.
     - Comparing sensor-triggered alerts with staff verification.
   - Findings:
     - Sensors produced **significant false positives**, likely due to:
       - Aerosols from deodorants, perfumes, or cleaning sprays.
       - Humidity changes.
       - High variability in vape chemical signatures.
     - These inaccuracies made it impractical to use sensors as a reliable enforcement tool.
   - Result:
     - Trials **were not scaled up**.
     - No system reached a reliability threshold suitable for nationwide deployment.

4. **Technology Evaluation Approach**
   - MOE indicates that schools/IHLs:
     - Will continue to **monitor emerging vape detection technologies**.
     - Will assess:
       - **Effectiveness**
       - **False positive rates**
       - **Maintenance requirements**
       - **Cost-effectiveness**
       - **Privacy implications** (if applicable)
     - Only if a system proves reliable will MOE consider wider rollout.

5. **Procurement and Privacy Guidelines**
   - The reply does **not** state the existence of:
     - Centralised procurement guidelines for vape sensors.
     - Ministry-wide privacy or data protection guidelines specifically for detection sensors.
   - It implies:
     - Because sensors are **not widely deployed**, MOE has not issued universal guidelines yet.
   - However, existing national frameworks likely still apply (though not mentioned here):
     - **PDPA principles**
     - **School safety and security policies**
     - **IT/system procurement governance**
   - MOE’s stance:
     - If vape sensors prove effective in future, **guidelines may be developed prior to scale-up**.

6. **Overall Ministry Position**
   - MOE is **cautious** about adopting vape detection technology due to reliability issues.
   - Focus remains on:
     - **Human-based detection**
     - **Education**
     - **Protocol-driven responses**
     - **Agency collaboration** (especially with HSA)
   - Technology adoption is **conditional** on proven reliability.

Key Entities:
- Ministry of Education (MOE)
- Health Sciences Authority (HSA)
- Schools
- Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs)
- Students
- Staff trained in detection protocols
- Dr Hamid Razak (MP)

Key Concepts:
- Multi-strategy vape detection in educational institutions
- Etomidate-related risk identification and response protocols
- Trials of vape detection sensors with high false positive rates
- Need for technology validation before deployment
- Inter-agency testing coordination with HSA
- Conditional approach to future procurement and guideline issuance
