4.         On 14 October 2020, in another case, CNB officers raided the residence of a 31-year-old Singaporean female in the vicinity of Yishun Street 51. As the occupants of the unit refused officers entry despite officers repeatedly identifying themselves, forced entry had to be effected. The 31-year-old female, along with a 19-year-old Singaporean male and a 17-year-old Singaporean female were arrested in the unit for suspected drug activities. A packet containing about 0.3g of ‘Ice’ was also seized from the unit.

5.         The 3-year-old daughter of the 31-year-old female was also present in the unit. Arrangements were made to ensure that the welfare of the 3-year-old girl was taken care of. The girl was subsequently placed in the safe custody of a next-of-kin.
