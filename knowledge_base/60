HSA Operation Uncovers Drugs and E-vaporisers with Etomidate, Two Persons Assisting in Investigations

On 22 July 2025, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) conducted an operation targeting illegal e-vaporiser sales, following an alert from a courier company. The courier staff had discovered that the parcel he was transporting contained e-vaporiser pods when the contents were accidentally exposed by the recipient of the parcel.  The parcel had been falsely declared to contain food items.

2        Acting on the information, HSA enforcement officers raided two locations. At the first location at a residence along Grange Road, HSA officers found drug paraphernalia, 43 e-vaporiser pods, 13 e-vaporisers and related components. A 25-year-old woman, identified as the seller, was found in an unresponsive state.  

3        The second raid, conducted at the buyer’s residence along Tampines Street 33 on the same day, uncovered about 0.6g of ‘Ice’ along with drug paraphernalia, more than 80 heat-not-burn tobacco products, one e-vaporiser, four e-vaporiser pods tested to contain etomidate, two packets and five sticks of duty-unpaid cigarettes. The buyer, a 34-year-old man was subsequently arrested for suspected drug-related offences by Police officers present at the scene. The suspected customs-related offence has been referred to Singapore Customs.

4        Both the seller and buyer are being investigated by HSA for e-vaporiser offences and Central Narcotics Bureau for suspected drug offences.
Penalties for e-vaporiser offences in Singapore

5        The purchase, possession and use of e-vaporisers are prohibited in Singapore under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act. This includes purchases made through the Internet and from overseas. HSA takes a serious view of these offences and will take stern action against those who violate the law. Offenders can be fined up to $2,000.

6        It is also an offence to import, distribute, sell or offer for sale e-vaporisers and their components. Any person convicted of an offence is liable to a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisonment of up to six months or both for the first offence, and a fine of up to $20,000, or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both for the second or subsequent offence. All prohibited tobacco items will be seized and confiscated.

7        Etomidate will soon be classified as a Class C controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Offenders caught using etomidate-laced e-vaporisers will be subject to mandatory supervision and rehabilitation. Repeat offenders are liable to be prosecuted and subject to jail for at least a year. More severe penalties apply to those selling, distributing or importing these devices, including imprisonment of up to 20 years and caning.

8        Users of e-vaporisers, particularly those consuming etomidate, are strongly urged to cease consumption immediately.
Reporting channels for e-vaporiser offences

9        Even as the government has intensified surveillance and enforcement measures against e-vaporisers, members of the public continue to play a crucial role in our fight against illegal e-vaporiser activities. Those who have information on the illegal advertisement, import, distribution, sale or possession of e-vaporisers can contact HSA to support our enforcement efforts through two convenient channels:

-       Submit information through our online reporting form: www.go.gov.sg/reportvape or scan the QR code:

-       Call the Tobacco Regulation Branch at Tel: 6684 2036 or 6684 2037, operational daily, including weekends and public holidays, from 9am to 9pm

10       HSA has partnered with the People’s Association to place e-vaporiser disposal bins across the island at 26 Community Clubs and one Resident’s Network Centre for members of the public to voluntarily dispose of e-vaporisers safely. They can visit go.gov.sg/bin-vapes to locate the nearest bin. Bins were also placed at the six autonomous universities. Persons who come forward to bin their e-vaporiser or voluntarily seek support for quitting will not face any penalties for doing so.

11       Information about the harms of e-vaporisers is available on the HealthHub website. Smokers or vapers who need help with quitting can call the Health Promotion Board’s toll-free Quitline at 1800-438-2000.
