FOR THE SITTING OF PARLIAMENT ON 9 SEPTEMBER 2024



Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament

Ms See Jinli Jean

Nominated MP



Question No. 6327



To ask the Minister for Health (a) how may taxi and private hire vehicle drivers report vaping in their vehicles by passengers; and (b) what workplace protection will the Ministry avail to such drivers in order to alleviate worries about negative repercussion or penalty on their livelihoods.



Written Answer



     Mr Speaker, we have addressed similar questions at the previous sitting and the answer has been provided in the Circular for Written Answers for Questions 33 and 34 on 6 August 2024. Nevertheless, for completeness, I will provide a reply to this Question today and invite the Member to seek clarifications, if need be.   


     While it is not mandatory for the taxi and private hire car drivers to report vaping by passengers, they may do so to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) via its hotlines. 


     The identities of persons who report these cases to HSA are kept confidential by HSA. Drivers will also not be penalised for passengers vaping in their vehicles. If passengers retaliate or are uncooperative, drivers can seek help from the relevant authorities, such as the Singapore Police Force, where appropriate.
