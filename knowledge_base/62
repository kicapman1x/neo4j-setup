HSA Detects Etomidate in Blood of Two Persons Involved in Fatal Punggol Road Accident

The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has detected the presence of etomidate in the blood samples of two persons who were involved in a fatal traffic accident on 13 May 2025. The car that they were in had collided with a bus along Punggol Road. The Police discovered 42 e-vaporisers and more than 1,200 pods in the car, with some tested by HSA to contain etomidate.

2        The driver, a 30-year-old male, was sent conscious to the hospital after the accident. The 28-year-old female passenger was conveyed unconscious to the hospital where she subsequently passed away. The driver is currently assisting the Police and HSA in investigations regarding both the accident and e-vaporiser-related offences.

3        Etomidate has clinical use as an anaesthetic agent and is permitted only in clinical settings and subject to strict conditions. The etomidate found in e-vaporisers or supplied in oil capsules or formulations to be inhaled directly into users' lungs are not medical products and are prohibited. The adverse effects of etomidate when used in e-vaporisers can be serious, including causing involuntary movements or spasm of muscles, confusion, seizures and psychosis. It can lead to physical dependence.
Penalties for e-vaporiser offences in Singapore

4        The purchase, possession and use of e-vaporisers are prohibited in Singapore under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act. This includes purchases made through the Internet and from overseas. HSA takes a serious view of these offences and will take stern action against those who violate the law. Offenders can be fined up to $2,000.

5        It is also an offence to import, distribute, sell or offer for sale e-vaporisers and their components. Any person convicted of an offence is liable to a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisonment of up to six months or both for the first offence, and a fine of up to $20,000, or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both for the second or subsequent offence. All prohibited tobacco items will be seized and confiscated.

6        Currently, persons found possessing or using pods containing etomidate are also liable upon conviction to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for up to 2 years and/or fine up to $10,000 under the Poisons Act. The Ministry of Health is working with the Ministry of Home Affairs to list etomidate as a Class C drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act in a few weeks’ time. This will enable tougher actions against suppliers and users of etomidate e-vaporisers. Users can be subject to supervision and mandatory participation in a rehabilitation programme, or committed to drug rehabilitation centres, like drug abusers. Recalcitrant offenders who repeatedly reoffend or commit other serious offences can be prosecuted and may be imprisoned for at least one year. HSA strongly warns consumers who are using e-vaporisers to stop use immediately.
