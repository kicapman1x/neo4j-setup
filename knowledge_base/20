Question No. 5461

To ask the Minister for Health (a) for each year in the last five years, what is the number and proportion of repeat vaping offenders from schools and institutes of higher learning; (b) what are the differentiated help programmes for re-offenders and their families; and (c) how effective are these programmes in helping youths to curb vaping addiction.

Answer

1     We do not have the data requested by the member.  However, based on data from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), between 2019-2023, for the offences of purchase, use or possession of e-vaporisers, there were 813 repeat offenders under 18 years old. This made up 25% of the number of offenders under 18 years old. 

2     The Health Promotion Board (HPB) works closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE), schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) on preventive education and providing nicotine cessation support for youths. 

3     These programmes include QuitLine and tele-counselling services, as well as on-site counselling through Student Health Advisors (SHAs). 

4     During these sessions, youths learn about the detrimental effects of smoking and vaping, and pick up strategies to quit and manage withdrawal symptoms.  In 2023, about 2,350 youths received smoking and vaping cessation counselling from these programmes, of which 38 percent have either reduced or quit smoking and/or vaping after one-month post-counselling.
